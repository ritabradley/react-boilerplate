# React Boilerplate

This is a minimal React boilerplate for those who find [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) a bit too bulky. This boilerplate doesn't have a lot of fluff, just Webpack, Babel, and some other essentials.

## How to use this boilerplate

1. Clone/download this repository
   - `git clone git@github.com:ritabradley/react-boilerplate.git` or `git clone https://github.com/ritabradley/react-boilerplate.git`

2) Start the development server by running `yarn run start`
